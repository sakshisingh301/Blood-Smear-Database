# Job Status & Search Feature

## Overview
The Job Status & Search feature allows users to check the processing status of their uploaded blood smear images and view detailed results including metadata and processed images.

## Features

### 1. Upload Confirmation
- After successful image upload, users see a confirmation message with:
  - ✅ Success icon and message
  - Job ID display
  - Automatic redirect to Job Status page (after 2 seconds)
  - Options to view status immediately or upload another image

### 2. Job Status Search
- **Search Bar**: Enter any Job ID to check status
- **Sample Job IDs**: Three demo job IDs for testing:
  - `job-12345` - Completed job with sample data
  - `job-67890` - Currently processing job
  - `job-11111` - Failed job with error details

### 3. Status Display
Each job shows comprehensive information:

#### Job Header
- Job ID
- Current status with color-coded badge
- Status message

#### Metadata Section
- Common Name
- Scientific Name
- Contributor
- Collection Date
- Source
- Upload Type

#### Images Section
- Image previews (currently using placeholder images)
- Image type classification
- Filename display

#### Status-Specific Information
- **Completed**: Processing time, completion timestamp
- **Processing**: Estimated completion time, animated progress bar
- **Failed**: Error details, failure timestamp, retry options

### 4. Navigation
- **Home Page**: "Check Job Status" button in hero section
- **Admin Upload**: Automatic redirect after successful upload
- **Direct Access**: Navigate to `/job-status` route

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `JobStatusPage.jsx` - Main job status page
- `JobStatusPage.css` - Styling for the job status page
- Updated `AdminUploadPage.jsx` - Upload success handling
- Updated `AppRoutes.jsx` - New route configuration

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for local state
- Simulates API calls with setTimeout for demo purposes
- Handles navigation with React Router

### Dummy Data
Currently includes sample data for three job types:
- **Completed**: Somali Ostrich full slide image
- **Processing**: Golden Retriever cellavision images
- **Failed**: African Elephant image with format error

## Future Integration

### API Endpoints
When ready to integrate with real backend:
1. Replace dummy data with actual API calls
2. Implement real-time status updates
3. Add WebSocket support for live progress tracking

### Image Handling
1. Replace placeholder images with actual uploaded images
2. Implement image compression and optimization
3. Add image viewer with zoom and pan capabilities

### Authentication
1. Add user authentication for job access
2. Implement job ownership validation
3. Add role-based access control

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Upload Images**: Use the Admin Upload page to submit blood smear images
2. **Get Job ID**: After successful upload, note your Job ID
3. **Check Status**: Use the Job Status page to monitor processing
4. **View Results**: Once complete, view metadata and processed images

### For Developers
1. **Testing**: Use the sample Job IDs to test different status scenarios
2. **Customization**: Modify dummy data in `JobStatusPage.jsx`
3. **Styling**: Update `JobStatusPage.css` for design changes
4. **Integration**: Replace dummy functions with real API calls

## Design Features

### Visual Elements
- **Color-coded Status**: Green (completed), Amber (processing), Red (failed)
- **Animated Progress Bar**: For processing jobs
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface matching UC Davis branding

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear paths between upload and status
- **Informative Feedback**: Detailed status information and error messages
- **Quick Actions**: Buttons for common tasks (retry, contact support)
- **Accessibility**: Clear labels and readable text

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Images Not Loading**: Placeholder images will show "Image not available"
2. **Job ID Not Found**: Verify the Job ID format and try again
3. **Status Not Updating**: Refresh the page or check network connectivity

### Demo Mode
- The current implementation is in demo mode
- All data is simulated for demonstration purposes
- Real API integration will replace the dummy data functions
